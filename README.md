# Pantry Tracker

### Why?

It'd be great to streamline my grocery shopping to a small set of ingredients that I know I'll need without going home to check what's in the cabinets.

I'd like to try new recipes without worrying about whether or not I already have what I need at home.

### Goals

- Have a virtual pantry that users can check ingredients into
- Users can cook something from a set of recipes based on their pantry
    * This will then remove that amount of each ingredient needed for the recipe from their pantry
- Users can generate a shopping list for a recipe or set of recipes that takes what's in their virtual pantry into account
